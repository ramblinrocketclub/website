## High Powered Rocketry

High Power Rocketry helps students at Georgia Tech build and launch their own high power rockets and get certifications from the National Association of Rocketry. 

## Georgia Tech Experimental Rocketry

Georgia Tech Experimental Rocketry (GTXR) flies the largest rockets at Georgia Tech with the ultimate goal of becoming the first college team to fly a two-stage rocket to the edge of space! With a target altitude of 100,000 feet, their next rocket "Mr. Blue Sky" will use two student developed P-class solid rocket motors and a new staging system.  Mr. Blue Sky is slated to fly in the summer of 2022--kicking off the next leg of their journey to the Karman Line.

## High Altitude Balloon

The High-Altitude Balloons team has the highest-flying and longest-running flights at Georgia Tech! The HAB team launches space weather balloons with complex payloads built by students and offers a safe research platform for labs around Georgia Tech to test components at high altitudes.
